Teams working remotely is more common then ever.  The combination of flexibility, high speed Internet, and the right tools make working remotely a viable option for may teams.  It's given rise to a whole generation of people that not only can work remotely, they expect it.  [reference]

What do I know about working remotely?  I worked successfully in a remote capacity for almost 3 years.  In that time, I lived in various parts of the United States, and traveled around the world with a program called Remote Year.  I am passionate about fostering a culture that allows teams to not only work remotely, but thrive.

There are 5 things are that are absolutely essential to fostering a healthy remote work culture.

## 1. Open communication

By far the most important part of a successful remote work culture is open communication.  What do I mean by this?  Think about how a traditional office operates.  There are hallway conversations, conversations at the water cooler, meetings, the cafeteria.  Sometimes the conversation is casual but other times its important work stuff that should be shared with your co-workers.

I can't tell you how many times in the past I've made some big technical decisions by bumping into a senior engineer in the hallway and asking his advice.  Sometimes bouncing ideas off other people helps you solve a problem.  In fast, this is the #1 reason company like to co-locate and put everyone in a single.  This is good for fostering ideas and innovation, but very bad for solving hard problems that require Deep Work.

Making decisions like this, however, is very bad.  Ideally the whole core engineering staff would also be involved at some level to make sure we don't a horrible mistake.  In a traditional office, this usually means meetings.  It's well known that meetings are a colosual waste of time and resources [reference].

The solution in a remote work environment is open communication using asynchronous tools.  For software development, this often includes tools like:

- Slack (asynchronous chat)
- Github (asynchronous software review)
- JIRA (asynchronous planning)
- Google Hangouts (synchronous meetings)

## 2.  Accountability

One of the bigger things that holds bigger or more traditional companies from allowing their employees to work part or full time remote is accountability.  The belief goes that if employees are being "watched" in the office they will slack off.  The truth is, if you have hired the right people, the oppositive will be true.  In fact, there are a lot of studies that show that people are actually more productive when they are free from the distractions of the office. [reference]

So how do you stay accountable as an employee?  Here are some ideas to build an accountable culture.

- #daily-standup.  A 15 minute synchronous meeting serves as face time for the team to talk about what they are working on today, and if there are any blockers.  You can also have a #daily-standup channel to provide more detail on Slack.
- #daily-announce.  This channel is to let people know that you aren't working.  Have to run some errands or want to do some laundry?  No problem, let the team know in this channel, and when you are back working let them know again.  No need to bother people, but if they want to know where you are, it should be in this channel.
- Task tracking.  I won't get into the whole Agile methodology here, but I want to emphasize that your team should break tasks out into small, manageable chunks.  This should improve velocity and allow for quick wins.  Also, surveys show that engineers are happier when they are deploying code often.  **As a general rule of thumb, try to make tasks that take no longer than 3 days to complete.**
- If something is going to take longer than expected, report this early on.  Make it known in a public slack channel so there are no surprises and get someone to help.

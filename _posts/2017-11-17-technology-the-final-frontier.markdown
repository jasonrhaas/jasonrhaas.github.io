Technology (and especially software) is constantly changing. Just because one
database, framework or programming language is popular now doesn’t mean it will
be in 5 years, or even 6 months. **A career in technology is a career is
constant learning.**

So how do you keep up with the latest? Here are a few pointers from my own
experience:

### Follow Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com)

I’m not saying you need to be on top of this constantly. But this is the pulse
of the tech/startup world. Many experienced developers, tech CEOs, and
entrepreuers post and comment on here.

It’s important to see what stories are getting lots of comments, and get a feel
for the general setiment of the community. Also — new frameworks or technologies
are often posted here and talked about.

### Follow your niche field

For me this is Python. I’m also interested in Entreprenuership. So I subscribe
to these two newsleters and at least browse through some of the content every
week:

[www.pythonweekly.com](http://www.pythonweekly.com)<br>
[www.foundersweekly.com](http://www.foundersweekly.com)

**I know what you’re thinking: Email is the worst.** And you would be correct in
thinking that. These newsletters are one of the far and few email subscriptions
that are actually meaningful and helpful. I recommend you find one similar in
your niche field.

### Go to (some) conferences

Technology conferences are a dime a dozen these days. What technology are in you
into? Kubernetes perhaps? Mesos? Or maybe just all things Big Data? Or maybe you
are really into Blockchain. Regardless of what it is, there seems to be a
conference for everything.

Honestly I usually don’t learn a heck of a lot from the conferences, but they
are a good way to see what other people are thinking and where the industry is
going. **It’s more of a “meet & greet” and making sure I’m ahead of the curve
rather than anything else.**

Unfortunately, a lot of of them are charging in the realm of multiple hundreds
of dollars to attend. In my opinion, most of them aren’t worth paying  money for
(with the exception of PyCon, of course).

However, some conferences such as DeveloperWeek offer free tickets if you are a
developer. The idea is that the companies and recruiters pay the big fees for
the chance at recruiting talent (you!).** Look for these “developer deals”, and
take advantage of them.**

Also — if you work for a company that is hip enough to pay for your nerd
conference, definitely take advantage of that as well.

### Speak at Tech Meetups

This is a good one. It will a give you a chance to give back to the community
and practice public speaking. Which — if you plan on running your own business
someday or even just being in a leadership position — is key.

Some Meetups, like the *Austin Python Meetup* have the regular talk, and then
“Lightning Talks” afterwards. A Lightning Talk just it’s typically 5–10 minutes
in length. **Lightning Talks are a great way to get comfortable speaking in
front of the crowd.**

### Use Open Source, and Contribute to it

> Many people and organizations are relying on Open Source today, yet less than 1%
> of users actually contribute back to Open Source.

I totally made that quote up, but its probably pretty close. I know —
contributing to *Flask* can be intimidating. The regular contributors to popular
Open Source projects know their stuff. **In fact — if companies see you are a
contributer to an Open Source Project, they may let you skip the demeaning “Live
Code Interview” process altogether.**

You don’t need to start with a big project, start small and work from there.
Also many projects have tags that specifically call out good tasks for people
new to the project — start with those.

### Don’t fall for all the new shiny things

> while, you might miss it — Ferris Bueller

Ok so there is always some new shiny thing that promises to be THE BEST DATABASE
EVER. You should definitely play around with all the new fancy things, but be
wary about using them in Production. Learn about it and figure out what it can
do that your existing stack or programming language can't.

**You know what powers most of the forward thinking technology companies today?
Unix.** Know when Unix was invented? The 70’s. Same goes with MySQL, Regular Old
Bash Scripts, and even (gasp) C++. Yea, C++ might not be “cool”, but there is a
reason why it still plays a big role in many of the tried and true tools that
are taken for granted today.
